#7.1 Create a list called years_list , starting with the year of your birth, and
#each year thereafter until the year of your fifth birthday. For example, if you
#were born in 1980, the list would be years_list = [1980, 1981, 1982,
#1983, 1984, 1985] . If you’re less than five years old and reading this
#book, I don’t know what to tell you.
